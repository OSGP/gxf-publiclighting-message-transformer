This package contains the data transfer objects (DTOs) used for public lighting throughout the Grid Exchange Fabric 
(formerly known as Open Smart Grid Platform).
These DTOs should be exactly the same as in the original OSGP DTO java project to ensure compatibility.
This means:
* same package structure
* same class names
* same field names and types
* same serialization mechanism (Java serialization)
