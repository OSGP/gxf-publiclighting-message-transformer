This package contains the shared exception objects used for public lighting throughout the Grid Exchange Fabric 
(formerly known as Open Smart Grid Platform).
These objects should be exactly the same as in the original java project to ensure compatibility.
This means:
* same package structure
* same class names
* same field names and types
* same serialization mechanism (Java serialization)
